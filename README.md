# CommunityDoodle
A simple flask-socketio web app with a shared canvas for doodling!

Run the file 'run.py' to start the socketio server. Navigate to localhost/canvas with a compatibale browser to start doodling on the canvas.

Once connected, your doodles will be shared with every socketio client connected. Also, if a client erases the canvas, every connected clients canvas will be erased.
